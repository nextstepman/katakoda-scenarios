# Mini Cloud Native Training

This is the result of my 24-hour-sprint exercise to try out katacoda. I used parts of our cloud native training
content - service meshes.

This scenario will walk you through the following steps

1. Setup kubernetes cluster
2. Install istio
3. Setup a part of the weave works example
4. Connect to jaeger and view service traces

This scenario uses material from the following sources:

* ISTIO, see https://istio.io/
* Weave works microservices demo, see https://github.com/microservices-demo

I used the weave works socks demo because it provides a nice example out of the box.
This scenario is not about weave works itself, another demo would work as well.
