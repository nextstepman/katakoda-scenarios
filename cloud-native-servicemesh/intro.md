# Mini Cloud Native Training

This is the result of my 24-hour-sprint exercise to try out katacoda. I used parts of our cloud native training
content - service meshes.

This scenario will walk you through the following steps

1. Setup kubernetes cluster
2. Install istio
3. Setup a part of the weave works example
4. Connect to jaeger and view service traces
