# Mini Flux Training

The purpose of this scenario is to have a sandbox to get started with flux, including a small k8s cluster. 

This scenario will walk you through the following steps

1. Setup kubernetes cluster
3. Install Flux and deploy the sock-shop application

This scenario uses material from the following sources:

* Flux, see https://github.com/weaveworks/flux/blob/master/site/introduction.md
* Weave works microservices demo, see https://github.com/microservices-demo

I used the socks demo because it provides a nice example out of the box and I used that as well in other training scenarios. 
This scenario is not about weave works or the sock shop itself, another demo would work as well.
